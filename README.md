# PHP Loose Comparison Bug
This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP related to loose comparisons. Loose comparisons (==) in PHP can lead to unexpected results due to type juggling.  This example highlights the problem and provides a solution using strict comparisons (===).

## Bug Description
PHP's loose comparison operator (==) can lead to unexpected behavior when comparing values of different types. It performs type juggling, which might result in comparisons returning true when they logically should be false.

## Solution
Always use strict comparison (===) to ensure that values are checked for both value and type.
