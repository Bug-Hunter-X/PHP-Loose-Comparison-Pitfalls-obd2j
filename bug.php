In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with string comparisons involving loosely typed variables.  Consider this scenario: 
```php
$value = "1";
if ($value == 1) { echo "True"; } else { echo "False"; }
```
This code will output "True", even though the variable \$value is a string and 1 is an integer. PHP's loose typing allows this comparison to succeed because it performs a type juggling before comparison, leading to unexpected results. The same issue can occur with other variable types like boolean, resulting in difficult-to-track bugs.

Another related issue arises when expecting the strict equality operator (===) for precise comparison but accidentally using the loose equality operator (==).  This can often occur after refactoring code where the variable type is altered.  This can be further compounded by the fact that both operators look similar.
