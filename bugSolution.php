To avoid these errors, always use the strict comparison operator (===) when comparing variables, especially when their types are uncertain.  This ensures that both the value and the type are compared for equality.  The corrected code example is:
```php
$value = "1";
if ($value === 1) { echo "True"; } else { echo "False"; }
```
Now, the code will correctly output "False" because the types are different.  Applying strict comparison consistently eliminates unexpected behavior arising from implicit type coercion.
